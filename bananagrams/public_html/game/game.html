This file is the 'game.html' which serves as the screen in which players are playing a game
of Bananagrams. The top are of the screen is the play grid, where players place their tiles to
form words. The bottom area shows the current tiles they have, and has buttons which allow them
to "peel" (get a new tile) and "dump" (replace one of their tiles with 3 new ones).

The javascript logic, including the HTTP requests, is located in 'js/game.js'.
The logic for the layout specifications are located in 'css/game.css'.
