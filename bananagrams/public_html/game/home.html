This file is the 'home.html' which serves as the home screen once a user is logged into
Bananagrams. It has two states: when first loaded, the page shows users their statistics, and
their friends' statistics. It also features a section which tells the user the rules of
Bananagrams, and a button which allows them to join the lobby. One in the lobby, the screen will
change to show the number of players in the lobby, and if the player was the first to join, a
button which will allow them to start the game.

The javascript logic, including the HTTP requests, is located in 'js/home.js'.
The logic for the layout specifications are located in 'css/home.css'.

                    The objective of Bananagrams is to be the first player to use all of
                    their letters.

                <div class="howToText">
                    Each player will start with 21 tiles. When the game begins, each
                    player races to arrange their tiles in their own intersecting word
                    grid... Words must read left to right horizontally, or top to bottom
                    vertically. Players may rearrange their grid at any time, and as often
                    as they like.
                </div>
                <div class="howToText">
                    If a player arranges all of their tiles in an interconnected grid,
                    they can “peel,” and each player will receive a new tile they must add
                    to their grid.
                </div>
                <div class="howToText">
                    If a player has a tile that they don't want to use, they can “dump,”
                    and return that tile to the pool and get 3 new ones. Players cannot
                    dump if there
                    are less than 3 tiles in the pool.
                </div>
                <div class="howToText">
                    When there are less tiles than players remaining in the pool, a player
                    can call “BANANAS!”. If their tiles are in a fully interconnected grid
                    and all of the words they have formed (horizontally and vertically,
                    NOT diagonally) are valid, they win the game. But: be careful, if a
                    player calls BANANAS and their board is not connected or contains
                    invalid words, that player will lose the game, and all other players
                    will be credited with a win.
