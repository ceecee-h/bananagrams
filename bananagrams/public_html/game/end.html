This file is the 'end.html' which serves as the end screen for after a game of Bananagrams
finishes. It has a button which allows users to return to the home screen, and a section which
shows their opponents from the game and allows the user to send a friend request to
those opponents. It will also tell the user who won the game.


The javascript logic, including the HTTP requests, is located in 'js/end.js'.
The logic for the layout specifications are located in 'css/end.css'.
