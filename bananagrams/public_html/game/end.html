-- STILL OOSTA / HOME.HTML, EDIT WHEN PAGE IS DONE --
This file is the 'index.html' which houses login & account creation for the web application,
Bananagrams. It has sections:
Login User - input a username & password and send a post request by clicking the button.
             the user will be then be logged in and redirected (assuming valid credentials)
Create User - input a username & password and send a post request by clicking the button.
              the user will then be created, an alert popping up for the client once successful.

The javascript logic, including the HTTP requests, is located in 'login.js'.
The logic for the layout specifications are located in 'login.css'.
