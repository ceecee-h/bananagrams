                Before you can play, you must log in. To log in, enter your username and
                password into the respective boxes on the home page. If you don't have an
                account or want to make a new one, click the link below the password box
                to be taken to the account creation page, where you can make a new account
                by entering the username you want to use (it must be one no one else has
                taken yet) and the password you will use to log in. Once you make an
                account, you can go back to the login page and use your new username and
                password to start playing. Once you've logged in, you'll be taken to the
                home screen. At the bottom of the page, familiarize yourself with the
                rules before jumping into a game by reading the “How to Play” section.

                Once you've logged in, you can join the current game by clicking the “JOIN
                GAME” button. Only one game can be played at a time, so if there are other
                players in the middle of a game, you'll have to wait until they're done
                before you can play. If there's not a game going on, you'll be sent to the
                lobby. If you're the first person who joins a lobby, you'll be the host.
                As the host, you can start the game by clicking the “START GAME” button
                when you're ready to play.

                To place your tiles, you must click on a space on the grid and then tile
                from your tile pool below (or vice versa). You may also swap tiles on the
                grid by clicking the two spots you want to swap. When you're ready to
                peel, you can click the “PEEL” button in the bottom right. If you want to
                dump a tile, first select the tile you want to get rid of, then click the
                “DUMP” button below the peel button. Be careful, when the game is ready to
                go BANANAS! the peel button will change to a “BANANAS!” button, so make
                sure your board is correct before daring to click.

                When the game ends, you'll be sent to the end screen. Here, you'll see who
                won, and you can send a friend request by clicking the “FRIEND” button
                next to their username. If they've already sent a friend request to you,
                or they send one back later, you'll become friends, and you will be able
                to see their stats on your home screen from now on.
